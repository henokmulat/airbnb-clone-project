- Booking System:Create a booking mechanism that allows users to reserve properties and manage booking details efficiently.  
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions securely and record payment details.  
- Review System: Enable users to leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in.  
- Data Optimization: Optimize database operations to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.
## Team Roles

### Backend Developer  
Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the server-side logic, APIs, and business logic. Ensures secure and efficient handling of user requests, data processing, and integration with databases and third-party services.

### Database Administrator (DBA)  
Manages the database system, including schema design, query optimization, backups, and data security. Ensures the database is reliable, scalable, and performant.

### Frontend Developer  
(If applicable) Builds the user interface and client-side logic, ensuring an intuitive and responsive user experience. Collaborates closely with backend developers to consume APIs.

## Technology Stack

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend RESTful APIs and managing server-side logic.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system used to store and manage all application data efficiently and securely.
- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and flexibility.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for secure user authentication and authorization, enabling stateless sessions.
- **Stripe:** A payment processing platform integrated to handle secure transactions and manage payment workflows.
- **Docker:** Containerization tool to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent deployment across environments.



### DevOps Engineer  
Handles deployment, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), server management, and infrastructure automation. Ensures the application runs smoothly in production environments.

## Database Design

### Key Entities and Fields

- **Users**  
  - `id`: Unique identifier  
  - `name`: Full name of the user  
  - `email`: User‚Äôs email address (unique)  
  - `password_hash`: Hashed password for authentication  
  - `role`: Defines if the user is a guest or host  

- **Properties**  
  - `id`: Unique property identifier  
  - `host_id`: References the user who owns the property  
  - `title`: Property title or name  
  - `description`: Detailed description of the property  
  - `location`: Address or coordinates of the property  
  - `price_per_night`: Cost per night for booking  

- **Bookings**  
  - `id`: Unique booking identifier  
  - `user_id`: References the user who made the booking  
  - `property_id`: References the booked property  
  - `start_date`: Booking start date  
  - `end_date`: Booking end date  
  - `status`: Status of the booking (confirmed, cancelled, etc.)  

- **Reviews**  
  - `id`: Unique review identifier  
  - `user_id`: References the user who wrote the review  
  - `property_id`: References the reviewed property  
  - `rating`: Numeric rating (e.g., 1-5 stars)  
  - `comment`: Textual feedback  

- **Payments**  
  - `id`: Unique payment identifier  
  - `booking_id`: References the related booking  
  - `amount`: Payment amount  
  - `payment_method`: Method used for payment (e.g., card, PayPal)  
  - `status`: Payment status (completed, pending, failed)  

### Relationships

- A **User** can be a **Host** (own multiple Properties) or a **Guest** (make multiple Bookings).  
- Each **Property** belongs to one **Host** (User).  
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** (Guest) and one **Property**.  
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property** they have booked.  
- A **Payment** is linked to one **Booking** and records transaction details.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  This feature handles secure user registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures that users can safely create accounts, log in, and manage their personal information throughout their interaction with the platform.

- **Property Management**  
  Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings. This includes adding detailed descriptions, images, and pricing, making it easy for users to browse and select properties that fit their needs.

- **Booking System**  
  Enables users to reserve properties for specific dates. The system manages booking details, availability checks, and allows users to view and modify their reservations.

- **Payment Processing**  
  Integrates a secure payment gateway to handle transactions between guests and hosts. It records payment details and ensures that financial operations are reliable and safe.

- **Review System**  
  Allows users to leave ratings and reviews for properties they have stayed at. This feature helps maintain transparency and builds trust within the community by providing valuable feedback.

- **Data Optimization**  
  Implements efficient database queries and indexing to optimize data retrieval and storage. This ensures the platform remains responsive and scalable as the user base grows.

  ## API Security

Security is a critical aspect of this Airbnb Clone backend to protect sensitive user data, ensure safe transactions, and maintain overall system integrity. The following key security measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication:**  
  Secure user authentication (e.g., using JWT or OAuth) will verify user identities before granting access to the APIs. This prevents unauthorized access and protects user accounts and personal information.

- **Authorization:**  
  Role-based access control will ensure users can only perform actions they are permitted to (e.g., only hosts can manage their own properties). This prevents unauthorized actions and maintains data integrity.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  To protect against brute force attacks and abuse, rate limiting will restrict the number of requests a client can make in a given timeframe. This helps maintain server stability and prevents denial-of-service attacks.

- **Data Validation and Sanitization:**  
  All input data will be validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

- **Secure Payment Processing:**  
  Payment transactions will be handled via trusted third-party services (e.g., Stripe) to ensure sensitive payment information is processed securely and not stored directly on the server.

Implementing these security measures is crucial to building user trust, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring the platform operates safely and reliably.
